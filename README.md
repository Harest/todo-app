## Fork Details
_I did some minimal changes, just so that the state of the tasks is stored. `Eventual TODO` means stuff i may do at a later point._
- Store the completed daily tasks (TODO: Add a way to clean up the stored states data)
- Navigate between days (Eventual TODO: Add a calendar to choose easily)
- Eventual TODO: Add tasks that are specific to a date, a day of the week, etc.

## Project Description 📑

- This is simple to-do checklist app for our daily needs.
- We can add our daily goals here.
- We can mark the tasks as completed, once they are done.
- We can delete the tasks, if we don't need them anymore.
- Tasks will remain stored here until we delete them.

## Optimizations ⌨️

**1. Refactors:**

Created _functions_ for the _repetitive code_.
